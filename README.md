## Project Summary
This project conducts data analysis to understand the relationship between a deprivation index, constructed using socioeconomic data from a variety of sources, and instances of eviction in the city of Chicago. The python application creates an interactive dashboard which summarizes the relationship betwen the the different factors. Follow the steps below to launch the dashboard.

## To Launch the Application

1. Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/uchicago-capp122-spring23/30122-project-apwhy
```
2. Navigate to the repository.
```
cd ./30122-project-apwhy
```
3. Install Poetry, which will allow the user to run the application in a virtual environment.
```
poetry install
```
4. Activate the virtual environment in poetry.
```
poetry shell
```
5. Launch the Application
```
python3 -m deprivation_evictions
```

The IDE may automatically launch a new web browser tab, or may provide a local URL. If the latter, paste it into your browser to view the interactive dashboard.
